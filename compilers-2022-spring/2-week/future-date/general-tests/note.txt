This folder contains test cases which checks the integrity of the lex parser.

These test cases should
    1. parse all the tokens without fail in the *.ok files.
    2. exit with "Lexical error" in *.lexical-error files

Example for *.ok file output:
T_ID
T_ADD
T_ID

Example for *.lexical-error file output:
T_NUM
T_ID
Line 2: Lexical error

Side notes: 
    1. The test cases do not check for the correctness of the solution, rather the overall stability of it.
    2. The tests might not capture all the cases, if you are doubtful of your solution, always add more test cases.
