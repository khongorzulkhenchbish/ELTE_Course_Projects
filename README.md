# Course: Programming Technology

## Game 1: Snake


I used [this Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SqnzvJuKiA) by Awais Mirza for the basic code and movement and further improved with **Object Oriented** approach. In addition, you can check the installation guide under the zipped directory.

__Used tools versions__:
- jdk 11, derby 10.14.2, apache netbeans 12.6.

## Game 2: Pebble


Pebble is a two-player game, played on a board consists of n x n fields. Initially, n white and n
black pebbles are placed on the board randomly. Each color belongs to only one player. The
players take turns choosing one of its pebble, and then move it horizontally or vertically. The
movement also affects the neighbouring pebbles in the direction (the pebble on the edge falls
off). The objective of the game is to push out as much pebbles of the opponent from the board
as we can, within a given number of turns (5n). A player wins, if he has more pebbles on the
board at the end than his opponent. The game is draw, if they have the same number of
pebbles on the board.
